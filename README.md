# RabbitMQ Exporter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/kbudde/rabbitmq_exporter?branch=master) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/kbudde/rabbitmq-exporter.svg)](http://microbadger.com/images/kbudde/rabbitmq-exporter "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")
Prometheus exporter for RabbitMQ metrics, based on RabbitMQ HTTP API.

### Dependencies

* Prometheus [client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) for Golang
* [Logging](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus)

### Setting up locally rabbitMQ and exporter with docker

1. Start rabbitMQ

        $ docker run -d -e RABBITMQ_NODENAME=my-rabbit --name my-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 9090:9090 rabbitmq:3-management

2. Start rabbitmq_exporter in container.

        $ docker run -d --net=container:my-rabbit kbudde/rabbitmq-exporter

Now your metrics are available through [http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics).

The rabbitmq_exporter is sharing the network interface with the rabbitmq container -> it is possible to use localhost and default user/password.
Disadvantage: you have to publish the port (9090) in the rabbitmq container.

### Configuration

Rabbitmq_exporter uses environment variables for configuration.
Settings:

* RABBIT_URL:      "http://localhost:15672",
* RABBIT_USER:     "guest",
* RABBIT_PASSWORD: "guest",
* PUBLISH_PORT:    "9090",
* OUTPUT_FORMAT:   "TTY", //change to JSON if needed
* LOG_LEVEL:       "info", // can be "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "fatal", or "panic"
* CAFILE:          "ca.pem", // default is ca.pem. If file does not exist it will be ignored.
* SKIPVERIFY:      false or 0, true or 1 // will skip hostname/certificate check at all
* INCLUDE_QUEUES:  ".*", // regex, matching queue names are exported
* SKIP_QUEUES:     "^$", // regex, matching queue names are not exported (useful for short-lived rpc queues). First performed INCLUDE, after SKIP

Example

    OUTPUT_FORMAT=JSON PUBLISH_PORT=9099 ./rabbitmq_exporter

## Docker

To create a docker image locally it is recommened to use the Makefile.
Promu is used for building the statically linked binary which is added to the scratch image.

       make docker
